# Entry 1: Deciding my topic
##### 10/15/25
# Context: 
I chose three topics that I wanted to do for my freedom project and my first option was music since I have a passion for music and to become a music artist in the future. My backup topics are photography/videography and luxury goods/jewlery. At first I considered art but I dont really know how to explain art technology. I don't really know how to make my website about music technology but I know I can do this and I'll get through with it. First I researched "music technology" since my topic for my project will be about music and I got most of my information from (https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/music/music-technology) by ESBCO since what most appear are universities with music technology courses. I always knew that music technology involved microphones, speakers and synthesizers but I never knew more technolgy involved with music, it's impressive how many technology is needed in order to create music. 
# Engineering Design Process
The first step in the Engineering Design Process is to define the problem. The problem I'm somewhat noticing is tha there's not alot of websites explaining the technolgy used in music and how it's used. I think that will be the purpose of my website: to teach everyone about the technology used in music. 
# Skills
The skills I have learned is time management and always looking for help when needed. I'm starting to realize that procrastinating isn't a bright thing to do, especially when you have been doing often and that I should start making a routine to not miss anymore work and to have time to do stuff I want to like play outcome memories or draw. I also really need to speak up if I need help because I won't get the help I need if I just sit still silently and wait for it to come.
