# Context: 
I am currently in the process of researching for my freedom project about music. I was researching the apps and the technology that was used for music that can be used for my project. 
# EDP:
Like I said in my context, I was researching for my project that is the topic of music. One app i discovered was [BandLab](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QhKa3YvEucCd51M0uiu4XYhYy1abr73sYb3cCXN9Uco7AY07LA4RRiCL7xSbeKjHXJA) where it helps people record and create music. A technology that is related to music was  [Auto interface](https://share.google/images/ypunEJrrjZ5aoHA1T) which ised for connecting microphones and other instruments to a computer. 
# Skills: 
One skill I learned was problem solving! I used to have tendency to give up on solving a difficult challenge to my short temper and my fraustation if something doesn't go right for me. One time I didn't know how to do the boarding for a coding challenge so I got fraustrated and was about to give up until I remember about the free code camp lessons and I looked for the one for boarding and I managed to make the boarding for the coding challenge.
